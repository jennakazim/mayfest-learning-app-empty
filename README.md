# Mayfest Productions Technology Stack Learning App

This is a project aimed for newcomers to the Mayfest Productions Technology Team. The purpose of this repository is for newcomers to be able to learn the general Mayfest Technology Tech Stack which consist of the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

**Note: Not all technologies that we use to build our projects are listed here, though this should give you enough of a general overview to get started and understand how to build scalable, modern, and professional web applications!**

_Note: This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`._

**This project was built was [Ethan Pineda](https://ethan-pineda.vercel.app/), Mayfest Productions Director of Technology 2024-2025**
